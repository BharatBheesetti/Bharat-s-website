        <h2>Love in the time of LLMs</h2>
        <p>Story 1: I remember talking to my friend around the time ChatGPT came out. He’s a super-intelligent senior
            developer with a lot of experience. He said something that’s stayed in my mind for a while. “I can now use
            it as a personal tutor. It’s so kind, understanding and patient. This is the teacher I’ve always wanted.
            I can ask it any stupid question I want.”</p>
        <p>Story 2: And then another friend, one who’s an analytics VP at a reputed organization. He marveled at GPT,
            loving everything about it. He said, “This plays the role of the helpful, smart junior that I’ve always
            wanted.”</p>
        <p>Story 3, scenario 1: Picture two friends, A and B who live quite far from each other and communicate regularly via text.
            A has a question about their career that they want an answer to. There's a lot of regret and insecurity
            at the root of that question and they’re quite sensitive about it. They bring this topic up with B, not
            without some trepidation. B understands A’s issue and recognizes that A needs a kick up the ass. So B
            attempts a little tough love, which has the intended effect. A’s quite miffed about the response for a few
            days, but once they calm down, they recognize the kernel of truth at the base of B’s slightly hurtful
            remarks.</p>
        <p>Story 3, scenario 2: A installs an AI-enabled therapist app. A brings up the same question with the AI
            therapist, Siggy. Siggy is calm, helpful, understanding, is a great listener, and can reference previous
            conversations. During this conversation, the AI therapist is not judgmental, provides a safe space, and
            gently leads A to the same epiphany that they had in scenario 1. </p>
        <p>Scenario 2 is not far-fetched, considering the rate of progress we are seeing in the LLM space. It will not
            be a rare occurrence. “Her” or “Be right back” from Black Mirror won’t be complete fantasies for much
            longer. Yes, the LLMs of now are stochastic parrots, centered around data retrieval + basic NLP tasks. But
            in the next few years, we will see the emergence of language models enabled characters that will be able to
            handle basic psychological support tasks. We would need long context windows and fine
            tuning on datasets that include anonymized conversations, best practices in psychological
            support and the ability to accurately categorize each person’s conversation history, coupled with a strong tagging and
            retrieval system.<br></p>
        <p>I’ve been thinking about the implications when a computer program is nicer, friendlier, calmer and more
            “loving“ than the vast majority of people out there. What will happen when we put these programs inside of
            humanoid robots? What strain will that put on expected human behavior in society when except a select
            minority of people, most people are worse at emoting and listening than computers?<br></p>
        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>The paradigm of social media is built on the attention economy - which makes sense. It’s the most sensible
            thing to sell ads on an online platform with millions of eyeballs + sticky usage. This
            incentivizes users to share things that will maximize reader engagement. </p>
        <p>Social media networks right now create a need for users to portray a specific image of themselves to the
            world around them, masks if you will. One mask for LinkedIn, one for Instagram, one for Snapchat and so on.
            We, as the audience, pick and choose the filaments of this firehose of information that we want to color our
            thoughts and opinions. The spaces you pick give you their own unique set of afflictions: pick from
            depression, self-esteem issues, hatred, bigotry etc. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958821000695/pdf">See this link for more.</a>  </p>
        <h3>Enter the LLM</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT is great. Most large language models advance human productivity significantly, specifically in the
            workplace. It’s surprising that a lot of in-office work is essentially doable by a word-predictor, but that
            is a story for another day. There have already been many attempts made at using the LLM’s to create
            conversational tools and storytellers.</p>
        <p>Replika AI is a standout example of the same. It’s not great at the moment, since the AI seems to lack basic
            conversational skills. It seems to be a well-designed if-else conversation tree, at least in the beginning
            of the user journey and seems to be focused on selling the “premium“ version which unlocks images in chat,
            no prizes for guessing what that would be used for. </p>
        <p><a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Inflection AI’s Pi</a> is a better example of this “personal AI” mission. They’ve recently raised $1.3 billion in funding to achieve this very goal.
            They have pre-trained their own model on an undisclosed dataset and have achieved a model that is
            significantly more human in conversation and feels like you’re talking to a real person. The interesting
            question is asking what happens if Pi is successful. What if Inflection AI really ends up building the LLM
            that can form the basis of AI applications that can interact with users as well as a human can? </p>
        <p>Most relationships are imperfect. Communication is imperfect, with suboptimal phrasing,
            misunderstandings, foibles and inefficiencies. Even if the meaning were completely preserved, everyone has
            their own problems and preoccupations in life, leading to many circumstances where conversations
            and relationships are not given the value they should be. </p>
        <p>Set against this backdrop, the promise of an eternally available, caring, personal, safe and non-judgmental
            AI seems like a utopian dream. It is the ultimate companion. It will easily win against the imperfect
            companionships humans have to offer. More fundamentally, it undercuts and renders obsolete the social reason
            humans have relationships. Humans have gotten together in communities for millions of years because it is
            safer. Because we can’t do it all by ourselves. The siren song that Inflection and the new AI mavens play,
            is that we can do it all by ourselves, with just our own personal AI daemon by our side. </p>
        <p>Tech has always promised us connection. And we have received it. We are now able to truly communicate, truly
        talk to people across the globe, no matter their thoughts, no matter their religion or ideological leaning.
        And as with everything, the effects are hard to reliably unpack. The atomisation of individuals, which has been helped
        along nicely by social networking, will see a step change once we build a true "Jarvis", a personal LLM that can interact with a person like another human
        can. As with all great internet inventions, it’s going to find its initial explorations of applicability in porn(already well
        underway). This trend is going to co-evolve with increasingly sophisticated and emotionally intelligent AI boyfriend and girlfriend apps.
        With a marriage not far off down the line. Applications are innumerable - senior care, child care, designated driving, personal emotional support. We will
        create the most emotionally healthy generations ever. Healthy relationships are a mechanism to dissipate emotional pain by distributing emotional labor among the 
        participants. A personal LLM removes the need for emotional labor, and with it, one of the core reason people persist with relationships. </p>
        <p>I am also a little curious about how the privacy and security concerns will shake out here. As a society, we
            have quite comprehensively placed our desire for convenience over privacy. People don’t really care if their
            addresses or if their Amazon shopping list get leaked. But picture this. What if poured your heart out to an
            AI therapist, and a data breach accidentally put out your deepest, darkest secrets? Companies are going to
            have to triple check every single part of their security exposure. </p>
        <p>It is noteworthy, however, that in an increasingly well connected world, we see more and more the
            individualization of the human being, of each node that makes up this great network. I don’t hold a moral
            stance on this being good or bad. With a well developed LLM humanoid, an internet connection, for the first
            time in history, a human could actually decide to cut themselves off physically from all human interaction,
            and actually lead an emotionally, physically and socially gratifying life. And I find that scary and
            beautiful at the same time. Like it’s a doorway we are all running towards, but no one is really talking about it.
