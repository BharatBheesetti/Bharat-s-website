        <h1>On automation, amnesia and events</h1>

        <p>Last month we wired up an LLM module that screens job applicants. It works well, much better than me and
            other hiring managers. Processing real documents, catching real issues. I sipped my coffee and briefly
            considered updating my LinkedIn bio to AI Visionary.</p>

        <p>This feeling lasted about forty-five minutes. Then someone on the ops team asked why someone was
            stuck in the pipeline for two weeks. Turns out, our beautiful automation had the long-term memory of Guy
            Pearce in <i>Memento</i>.</p>

            alt="Guy Pearce in Memento holding a polaroid, captioned: I have this condition" class="imageresponsive">

        <p>I've been building these automated modules for a couple of years now. Document verification, compliance
            checks, automated assessments, scoring. Each one of them works. They all make the quarterly review pleasant,
            relatively. But
            I keep running into a speedbump when I try to connect them into something end-to-end. More of an
            organizational issue than a technical or (as I feared briefly) because of localised incompetence.</p>

        <p><b>For a large enterprise looking to automate business and ops lines and realise the magical boost to product
                and business metrics, the ceiling on your agent strategy isn't model or agent capability.
                It's whether your organisation has actually agreed on how to remember things.</b></p>

        <h2>Automated silos are still silos</h2>

        <p>Every division in a business is automating its own piece. One team automates lead qualification. Another
            automates onboarding. Another automates fulfilment. Another automates support. Each builds its own agent
            coalition, and each coalition handles its domain just fine. All the respective product managers grin and
            write "AI agents shipped, cut costs by 95%" on their CV.</p>

        <p>But a customer doesn't live inside one division. They flow through the whole business. Discovered, evaluated,
            signed up, onboarded, served, supported, renewed. The value the business provides to the customer is in the
            coherence of that end to end journey, not in any single
            team's local win.</p>

        <p>When a customer crosses from one team's domain to the next, the receiving team's agents have no idea what
            happened before. What was flagged, what was waived, what was decided. Mostly, the agents start from zero.
            You've automated
            the silos, but the silos are still silos. Five teams with five agent coalitions, collectively dumber than
            one ops person who had access to all the spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>Say an agent needs to handle a support escalation. Customer's stuck and nobody can figure out why. The agent
            has to rummage through the sales CRM, the risk database, the onboarding system, the product database, the
            billing platform. Different schemas. Probably different IDs for the same customer. It's like asking someone
            to do a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are spread across five rooms and some of them are from a different
            puzzle entirely.</p>

            alt="Charlie from Always Sunny conspiracy board meme: There is no foreign key. The join does not exist."
            class="imageresponsive">

        <p>Now picture the alternative: a clean event stream. One chronological story. Signed up &rarr; evaluated &rarr;
            approved &rarr; onboarded &rarr; activated &rarr; first issue &rarr; stuck 14 days. One stream. No joins.
            The agent can spend its intelligence on solving the problem instead of assembling it from scratch.</p>

        <p>State tells you the patient is dead. Events tell you why.</p>

        <img src="blogpostpics/diagram_silos_vs_events.png"
            alt="Diagram comparing siloed teams losing context at every handoff versus teams connected by a shared event stream preserving full context"
            class="responsive">

        <h2>"Just give agents database access"</h2>

        <p>A dev friend of mine countered my argument. If agents need context, give them database access. Let them
            query what they need. Models are smart enough.</p>

        <p>He's half right. For investigation (figuring out why something went wrong after the fact) database access
            works. An agent can query five systems, reconstruct the timeline, give you an answer. Slow, expensive, might
            hallucinate some joins, but it gets you there.</p>

        <p>Operational coordination is a different problem. Investigation is forensic. Coordination is live. When your
            risk team's agents flag a pattern in incoming applications, the onboarding team doesn't need to investigate
            that three weeks later. It needs to know now, so it can adapt. Database access gives you archaeology while
            events
            give you a nervous system.</p>

        <p>There's a related argument: context windows are big enough now, just dump everything in and let the model
            sort it out. This doesn't quite work either. Context windows are still limited to session level. They're not
            long-term memory (yet). And expanding context windows actually makes agent behaviour worse (for now). More
            context
            often leads to noise, drift and worse decisions. The answer to "agents can't
            remember" isn't "give them more to read."</p>

        <p>There are three different memory problems emerging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What happened in this conversation (session memory) </li>
            <li>What this agent knows across conversations (agent memory) </li>
            <li>What all agents across the business collectively know (organisational memory) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The industry is making progress on the first
        two. Mem0, Letta, various retrieval setups. The third, the one that actually determines whether your
        automated business functions as a whole, is largely unsolved (<a
            href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/">OpenAI is making strides here</a>, and we'll
        see more of this in 2026). MCP is going stateless. Google's A2A treats
        agents as opaque black boxes. The standardisation efforts are deliberately leaving organisational memory to
        you.</p>

        <h2>What it looks like when it works</h2>

        <p>I've tried to get this across in planning meetings, to mixed reception.</p>

        <p>Support agents notice a spike in complaints from a specific customer segment. Turns out they all went through
            an expedited onboarding flow that skipped a validation step. That signal flows to the onboarding team, which
            fixes the gap. Sales sees the change and adjusts what they promise in the pitch. The loop closes across four
            teams without anyone calling a meeting.</p>

        <p>This executive wet dream is the promise of what happens when a business has shared memory. Teams publish what
            actually happens (a document
            verified, a status change, a score assigned) as events that other systems can subscribe to. Team A ships an
            automated screening module and publishes <code>application.screened</code>. Team B is building quality
            monitoring. Without shared history, Team B has to negotiate database access, build a custom integration, or
            (God help us) request a CSV export. With shared events, they subscribe. No meetings. No week-long
            integration project.</p>

        <p>The fifth automated module ends up cheaper to build than the first, because the infrastructure is already
            there and the system has memory. That's compounding. And the compounding is both cost and intelligence.
            Each new module makes the whole system smarter because it can see what every other module did. The business
            learns as a whole, and it's because the agents (proxies for their individual business divisions) can truly
            see each
            other's work as it happens.</p>

        <p>Steve Yegge describes <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-anthropic-hive-mind-d01f768f3d7b">something
                similar</a> happening at an AI native startup. They keep the full work history of
            everything every human and agent has done, as an append-only log. His take is that the models need that
            context to
            merge their work intelligently. That's the difference between a collection of disconnected sprint demos and
            a business that actually compounds.</p>

            alt="Compounding intelligence flywheel: new module ships, publishes events, other modules get smarter, next module cheaper to build"
            class="responsive">

        <p>Evweyone knows events are important, Bharat, I hear you say. Events have been critical for a while
            now, but they take center stage in the age of agents, when individual business functions are rapidly getting
            autonomous.
            
            Coordinating biz divisions to ensure they pulled in the same direction took a ton of work. It took cadres of
            middle management and reams of reports. People in meetings. People reading dashboards. People walking over
            to ask "Hey, what's going on with this customer segment?" Slow but effective. Those humans are now being replaced by
            agents that can't walk over and ask. The informal coordination layer that people provided for free is
            disappearing, and something has to replace it.</p>

        <p>Shared memory replaces the hallway conversation.</p>

        <h2>Why nobody does it (incentives, obviously)</h2>

        <p>Obviously, devs and engineering leaders are well aware of this. But incentives often get in the way.
            Dependency balance is delicate. You
            can't ask teams to plan everything with dependencies in mind, velocity just dies. Engineering leaders know
            this debt is piling up. They ship anyway, because incentives reward shipping. More budget, more headcount,
            more time. That's how they plan to handle integration: later.</p>

        <p>Everyone rationally chooses velocity over cross team coherence. The cost of not doing it is invisible
            until it isn't. Until you can't build what your roadmap says you should build because your systems can't
            talk to each other and what should have taken a sprint to build takes a month or more (sprint = day and
            month = weekend now)</p>

        <p>ICLR 2026 has a workshop on agent memory and 80% of agentic issues are coordination related. BCG and MIT
            surveyed 2,100 executives and concluded that agentic AI is "inherently cross-functional," cutting across
            organisational boundaries in ways previous technologies didn't. Three quarters of companies plan to deploy
            agents by end of 2026. One in five has the governance readiness for it.</p>

        <p>I've seen teams build elaborate data pipelines to reconstruct
            information that should have been published as it happened. I've seen integrations held together by
            credential-locked spreadsheets processed by macros. I have nothing but respect for the people maintaining
            those systems. They're solving real problems with whatever they've got. But each workaround is a system
            trying to remember things it was never designed to record.</p>

        <img src="blogpostpics/lumbergh_shared_memory.jpg"
            alt="Lumbergh from Office Space: If you could just add integration to the backlog, that'd be great"
            class="imageresponsive">

        <h2>Memory</h2>

        <p>Borges wrote about a man who remembers everything, every leaf, every sensation, and is paralysed by it.
            Systems without memory, agentic or othewise, have the opposite problem. They function, but they can't
            explain themselves,
            can't learn from their own history, can't coordinate across divisions on anything that requires knowing what
            came before.</p>

        <p>If you're deploying agents across business lines, you will hit this wall. Your individual modules will work.
            Your connected pipeline won't. The root cause won't be model quality or prompt engineering. It'll be that
            your systems have amnesia, and your agents inherited it.</p>

        <p>Everything interesting starts with memory.</p>
