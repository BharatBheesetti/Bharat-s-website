# Bharat Bheesetti - Writing Style Analysis

Each section below is an independent analysis of one blog post, identifying concrete writing style signifiers with examples.

---

## Post: Work slop - a rant against vibe working

### 1. Opening with immediate declarative stakes
**Pattern:** Jumps straight into bold, absolutist claims without preamble or hedging.

Evidence:
- "The biggest problem in the world will be answering - Is this slop?"
- "Slop at work is getting worse, and it'll continue to get worse."
- "Back in the good old pre-GPT days of 2022, writing meant something."

### 2. Sentence fragments for emphasis and rhythm breaks
**Pattern:** Uses intentional fragments after longer sentences to create punch, often starting with "And" or "Or" or just noun phrases.

Evidence:
- "At work, in your personal life."
- "Or those 30 lines of code (half of them are comments) for an if statement."
- "Which is okay."

### 3. Parenthetical asides that add specificity or snark
**Pattern:** Drops in parentheticals mid-sentence to add detail, sarcasm, or qualification without breaking flow.

Evidence:
- "in that suspiciously elaborate slack response to 'Why did this feature break?'"
- "the 20 pages of rambling nonsense, maybe even without the 'Here you go' parts cleaned up"
- "(half of them are comments)"

### 4. Blunt, informal register with technical precision
**Pattern:** Mixes casual/vulgar language ("shit ton," "slop") with precise technical or analytical observations.

Evidence:
- "you get a shit ton more output as opposed to before, but not much more high quality output"
- "the ghost of understanding pulled from a shitty, low effort prompt and its neighbors in latent space"
- "It just summarizes the ghost of understanding pulled from a shitty, low effort prompt and its neighbors in latent space."

### 5. Scare quotes to signal ironic distance
**Pattern:** Uses quotation marks around terms to signal skepticism or to highlight the performative/artificial nature of something.

Evidence:
- "I particularly love those documents where the headings are modified so that they don't **'Read Something Like This'**, but clearly the 'writer' couldn't be bothered"
- "When LLM's erase the friction involved in creating output"
- "Give me back my time."

### 6. Lists with escalating specificity that build to a point
**Pattern:** Accumulates examples or observations that get more specific/damning as they progress.

Evidence:
- "The document seems well formatted, well structured and consistent. But the logic is spotty, there's no through-line of conviction, there are clear inconsistencies in reasoning and worst of all, there's no opinion."
- "Writing that doesn't illuminate, educate or put forth a view."
- "I end up with empty, small, shallow, barely functioning stuff."

### 7. Personal anecdote as evidence structure
**Pattern:** Shifts from abstract argument to "Take my example" to ground the criticism in lived experience.

Evidence:
- "Take my example. I've tried to vibe code a few things."
- "The harder part is when I'm putting in the effort, when I've written out clearly what I want, the flows, how it should look, how it should behave. And then the model doesn't grok it."
- "And my reward is trying it again."

### 8. Single-sentence paragraphs for conceptual punches
**Pattern:** Isolates key observations or conclusions in their own paragraph for emphasis.

Evidence:
- "This pulls upon an important thread, the one about taste."
- "There are few experiences so anticlimactic as reading slop."
- "You're emptier when you finish reading it."

### 9. Pop culture/internet reference as closing mic drop
**Pattern:** Ends with a reference that assumes shared cultural knowledge, delivered as a quotation that summarizes the argument.

Evidence:
- "'And no, Pepe Silvia, I will not spend time reading your proposal when you couldn't be bothered to spend time writing it.'"
- "We need slopblock like we needed ublock origin."

### 10. Temporal contrast to frame decline narrative
**Pattern:** Uses "back then vs now" structure with specific dates to create a before/after moral framework.

Evidence:
- "Back in the good old pre-GPT days of 2022, writing meant something."
- "That's no longer the case."
- "Everyone's raving about taste these days. When the marginal cost of creation goes to zero, the only valuable thing is taste."

## Post: Janet, Raj and the dawn of Personal Software

### 1. Ultra-Short Declarative Opens
Starts with punchy, fragmented statements that function as thesis declarations rather than traditional topic sentences.

**Evidence:**
- "It's long past time. Call it. LLMs are eating the world."
- "Most B2B SaaS tools are CRUD applications with UI frameworks and enterprise billing."
- "LLMs make intelligence economical."

### 2. Metaphor as Diagnostic Tool
Uses vivid, slightly absurd metaphors to diagnose system dysfunction rather than just describe it.

**Evidence:**
- "we haven't automated work, we have just digitized bureaucracy"
- "Knowledge workers spend their days transferring data between SaaS platforms, functioning as 'a fleshy API router between incompatible databases.'"
- "Most B2B SaaS tools are... Excel in a Trenchcoat"

### 3. Anecdotal Grounding Before Abstraction
Moves from specific, relatable workplace frustration (approving a $50 subscription) into broader theoretical claims. The personal story validates the big idea.

**Evidence:**
- Opens with navigating "a Slack request, manager email, a portal with login timeouts, and a gchat message" before declaring that bureaucracy hasn't been automated
- Uses "Janet and Raj" as concrete characters managing invoices before discussing the broader SaaS fragmentation problem

### 4. Sentence Fragment Rhythm for Emphasis
Deploys intentional fragments to create declarative punch, especially at transition points.

**Evidence:**
- "It's long past time. Call it."
- "The fundamental shift: moving from 'Software as a Service' to 'Service as Software.'"
- "Their days are numbered."

### 5. Colon-Driven Clarification Pattern
Heavily relies on colons to set up thesis-statement structures that deliver the key insight after the colon.

**Evidence:**
- "The fundamental shift: moving from 'Software as a Service' to 'Service as Software.'"
- "This creates demand for 'LLM-native problem solver[s]'—PMs, ops professionals, or engineers understanding probabilistic systems who 'write Evals' rather than rules."

### 6. Concrete-to-Abstract Ratio in Technical Concepts
When introducing technical shifts, immediately grounds them in specific numbers, use cases, or observable changes rather than staying theoretical.

**Evidence:**
- "Klarna's AI assistant handled two-thirds of customer service chats in its first month, replacing nearly 700 agents."
- "Pricing models shift from seat-based ($30/user/month) to outcome-based (tickets resolved)."
- "Small teams (2-3 people) with strong problem-solving skills and LLMs can accomplish what previously required larger teams."

### 7. Quotable Aphorism Construction
Crafts standalone sentences designed to be quotable maxims that compress the entire argument into a single memorable line.

**Evidence:**
- "Evaluations become the PRDs, the sales collateral, even the product itself."
- "Janet's boss doesn't want Janet to manage tools for invoices. She wants the invoices managed."
- "Generic tools 'that kind of fit your process but not really; their days are numbered.'"

### 8. Plain-Speak Takedown Style
Uses deliberately casual, almost dismissive language to deflate the perceived sophistication of existing systems.

**Evidence:**
- "Most B2B SaaS tools are CRUD applications with UI frameworks and enterprise billing"
- "Excel in a Trenchcoat"
- "Generic tools 'that kind of fit your process but not really'"

### 9. Character-Based Abstraction
Creates representative characters (Janet, Raj) to embody systemic problems rather than using generic "users" or abstract roles.

**Evidence:**
- "Janet and Raj manage invoices using NetSuite and Coupa alongside other tools"
- "Janet's boss doesn't want Janet to manage tools for invoices"
- The post title itself: "Janet, Raj and the dawn of Personal Software"

### 10. Economic Frame for Tech Shifts
Consistently anchors technological transformation in economic terms—cost, pricing models, labor replacement—rather than capability narratives.

**Evidence:**
- "LLMs make intelligence economical"
- "Pricing models shift from seat-based ($30/user/month) to outcome-based (tickets resolved)"
- "Klarna's AI assistant... replacing nearly 700 agents"

## Post: Llama says WhatsApp - voluntary lock-in

### 1. Opening with Personal Anecdote as Frame Device
The author consistently uses personal experience to establish credibility and relatability before pivoting to analysis.

**Evidence:**
- "My WhatsApp is a mess, and I have a theory about why. I'm kinda particular about a zero inbox, and about keeping spam off my WhatsApp home."
- "As a result, my user experience everyday has those short but irritating moments where I have to block yet another business sending unrequited feedback requests or irrelevant advertisements."
- "No, Acme, I don't want your Diwali offers now. Go ask Wile E."

### 2. Conversational Hedging and Informal Qualifiers
Uses casual modifiers that soften analytical claims while maintaining a conversational tone.

**Evidence:**
- "I'm kinda particular about a zero inbox"
- "It was quite fun trying to unpack Meta's strategy"
- "WhatsApp seemed an odd fit here"

### 3. Sentence Fragments for Emphasis
Deploys incomplete sentences as standalone statements to create rhythm and highlight key points.

**Evidence:**
- "Facebook apps? That was supposed to be the platform that would eat the internet. Then mobile happened."
- "Can't train AI models. Can't improve spam detection. Can't do anything smart with the world's largest messaging dataset because technically, you can't see it."
- "All while maintaining the appearance of choice and openness."

### 4. List-Like Cascading for Building Momentum
Chains related ideas without conjunctions to create accumulating effect.

**Evidence:**
- "Can't train AI models. Can't improve spam detection. Can't do anything smart with the world's largest messaging dataset"
- "Access to 2 billion DAU's locked into encrypted personal chats, businesses voluntarily sharing data for better tools, training data for AI models from real business interactions, no platform dependencies or taxes, revenue without breaking encryption promises."
- "WhatsApp Pay expansion builds the transaction layer. Channels normalize non-E2E spaces. Business catalogs lay commerce infrastructure."

### 5. Parenthetical Asides for Meta-Commentary
Uses parentheticals to add snark, clarification, or additional context without breaking main argument flow.

**Evidence:**
- "Suddenly Facebook was living in Apple and Google's world (still is)"
- "they've proven that people will buy where they already spend their time. TikTok Shop's insane revenues show you the ultimate, distilled form of this playbook."
- "Meta didn't opensource Llama just because they believe in AI democratization (though that PR certainly helps)"

### 6. Section Headers with Personality
Bold headers use playful references, metaphors, or unexpected phrasing rather than generic descriptors.

**Evidence:**
- "**All your platforms are belong to us**" (meme reference)
- "**The Art of Voluntary Lock-in**"
- "**The Two-Way Feed**"

### 7. Pattern Recognition as Analytical Device
Explicitly names and tracks repeating patterns across companies/scenarios to build argument.

**Evidence:**
- "The pattern keeps repeating. Meta revenue drops when Apple lets users block tracking. Facebook's ad targeting suffers when Google tweaks Android permissions."
- "It's the same pattern we saw with Facebook Pages (organic reach → paid reach) and Instagram Shopping (free listing → paid integration), but executed with more subtlety."
- "It's the same playbook Meta's running with Llama - open source the core, monetize the tooling."

### 8. Strategic Use of "Here's where" for Transitions
Signals pivotal moments in argument with direct, conversational signposting.

**Evidence:**
- "Here's where Meta's strategy gets deliciously clever."
- "This is where Llama matters, and not just as another AI play."

### 9. Humor Through Pop Culture and Absurdist References
Injects levity through unexpected cultural allusions and exaggerated scenarios.

**Evidence:**
- "No, Acme, I don't want your Diwali offers now. Go ask Wile E." (Looney Tunes reference)
- "**All your platforms are belong to us**" (Zero Wing meme)
- "Like all great platform transitions, users rarely notice until it's done."

### 10. Long-Form Closing Paragraphs with Cyclical Return
Concludes with extended paragraph that brings analysis full circle back to opening anecdote.

**Evidence:**
- "Like all great platform transitions, users rarely notice until it's done. WhatsApp's evolution from clean messaging app to AI-powered commerce platform won't happen with a bang. It'll happen gradually, one blocked spam message and one business interaction at a time, until one day we realize the messaging app we knew is gone, replaced by something else - but owned by Meta. But hey, at least those Diwali offers might learn to show up at the right time."

## Post: One Battle After Another - A Review

### 1. Opening with Personal Stakes Through Contrast
The writer opens by establishing emotional credibility before diving into specifics, using "There's something about..." to signal intimacy.

**Evidence:**
- "There's something about Paul Thomas Anderson movies that cuts straight through."
- "The first thing that struck me is how dynamic this film is despite its nearly three-hour runtime."
- "Then there's that chase scene. I need to talk about the chase scene."

### 2. Comma-Heavy List Building Without Conjunctions
Creates rhythmic accumulation by stacking clauses with commas, avoiding "and" until the very end, building momentum through enumeration.

**Evidence:**
- "Immigrant detention, white supremacist power structures, the surveillance state, all rendered with a surreal edge"
- "It's frenetic and funny and frightening, often in the same scene."
- "The detention centers, the white supremacist violence, the authoritarian creep, all of it is plain for everyone to see."

### 3. Parenthetical Emphasis for Emotional Texture
Uses italics within sentences not just for movie titles but to add emotional stress or internal dialogue quality to key moments.

**Evidence:**
- "You want Bob to survive. You need him to make it. That primal desire for the protagonist to just *get there*, to save his daughter"
- "watching it in IMAX felt necessary, urgent even."
- "Imperfectly, messily, but genuinely."

### 4. Short Declarative Sentences as Emotional Punctuation
Drops in brief, emphatic statements after longer analytical passages to create emotional impact and redirect focus.

**Evidence:**
- "The scale demands it."
- "And somehow, that's enough."
- "This is one of them."

### 5. "Both/And" Contradiction Framing
Regularly presents seemingly contradictory qualities as coexisting, using structures like "both X and Y" or "X, Y, and Z" to capture complexity.

**Evidence:**
- "makes the horror both more bearable and more cutting"
- "He's terrifying, pathetic, and darkly hilarious, often in the same scene."
- "watching him perform cruelty to prove his worth, is both revolting and heartbreaking."

### 6. Gerund Chains to Show Process and Accumulation
Uses repeated "-ing" verb forms to show ongoing actions layering upon each other, creating a sense of witnessing things unfold.

**Evidence:**
- "Watching him curry favor with these men, watching him perform cruelty to prove his worth"
- "the burden of caring for a parent who should be caring for you, the exhaustion of managing someone else's paranoia"
- "watching it in IMAX felt necessary, urgent even."

### 7. Colon-Introduced Explanations That Deepen Insight
Frequently uses colons to introduce clarifying thoughts that reveal the deeper meaning behind a previous statement.

**Evidence:**
- "Penn makes you understand the psychology of fascism: the way insecurity curdles into violence, the way people trade their humanity"
- "PTA is arguing something essential here: people naturally gravitate toward helping each other."
- "It's his most entertaining film and one of his most thematically rich."

### 8. Direct Reader Address Through Emotional Universals
Shifts from "I" to "you" to draw the reader into shared emotional experience, making the analysis feel collaborative.

**Evidence:**
- "You want Bob to survive. You need him to make it."
- "I can revisit it endlessly and always find something new."
- "In times like these, we need stories that uplift us"

### 9. Adjective Pairs Separated by Commas for Rhythmic Build
Stacks descriptive words with commas rather than "and," creating a more measured, thoughtful rhythm.

**Evidence:**
- "weird, profoundly weird movie"
- "strange and vital here"
- "clear-eyed recognition of what endures"

### 10. Thematic Reframing in Final Paragraphs
Concludes by zooming out to broader meaning, often using "ultimately" or similar markers to signal the shift from analysis to thesis.

**Evidence:**
- "Because that's what this film ultimately is: a protest movie."
- "PTA has made something strange and vital here."
- "I'll be catching it again soon. Some films demand to be revisited. This is one of them."

## Post: The data wall or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bitter lesson

### 1. Sentence Rhythm: Short declarative punches followed by explanatory builds
- "But what is it?" (abrupt, single-sentence paragraph for emphasis)
- "And it worked. Really well." (fragment used for impact after longer technical explanation)
- "Details are sparse, not too much gets out to the public." (conversational run-on that mirrors speech patterns)

### 2. Opening Paragraphs: Personal experience → broader context
- "I was reading Leopold Aschenbrenner's essays, 'Situational Awareness'. They hold up quite well in spite of being 7 months old, an eternity in the AI space."
- "At Telus Digital, we help companies tackle their data needs for ML model training. Our client base runs the gamut from teams building large language models to those working on autonomous vehicle systems."
- "A few days ago, a Chinese lab called DeepSeek dropped a bombshell." (narrative hook with dramatic language)

### 3. Humor Mechanics: Deadpan understatement in technical contexts
- "You start by scraping the internet, deduplicate and clean the data, then run it through a model with enough parameters to make your cloud provider wince."
- "500 billion dollars should get you a decent amount, I'd imagine."
- "Somewhere, the author of the no-moat memo is doing a victory lap."

### 4. Technical Concept Handling: Plain language translation immediately after jargon
- "What you got was a pre-trained model that could predict the next token with impressive accuracy - but fell flat when asked to be anything resembling a useful assistant." (explains limitation in human terms)
- "They basically told their model 'hey, figure it out yourself.' They used reinforcement learning - having the model generate answers, checking if they're right, and learning from that process." (informal summary before technical detail)
- "The alpha isn't in having more labeled data - it's in having the right experts who can understand where models fail and provide targeted, high-quality feedback." (uses "alpha" as domain-specific jargon, then clarifies meaning)

### 5. Transition Patterns: Question-based pivots and direct statements
- "But what is it?" (single-line question paragraph)
- "So what?" (section header as blunt question)
- "However, in practice, LLM's can get better by using smaller but high-quality, filtered and cleaned pre-training datasets." (classic "however" pivot with specific counter-example)

### 6. Punctuation Habits: Dash for explanatory asides and em-dash elaborations
- "The transformation from text predictor to chatbot happens through human intervention in two phases."
- "the model would generate multiple responses to prompts, with humans selecting the better options iteratively, teaching the model to align with what we actually wanted from it."
- "Scale AI - the market leader in data labeling - is hitting $1B in annual revenue." (parenthetical dashes for clarifying details)

### 7. Reader Positioning: Assumes informed but not expert reader
- "Looking back at the pre-ChatGPT era of 2022, model training followed a fairly 'straightforward' path" (scare quotes signal complexity while maintaining accessible tone)
- "I strongly recommend reading Nathan Lambert for a more detailed explanation of the advances in post training." (direct recommendation assumes engaged, curious reader)
- "This industry is often overlooked and poorly understood." (positions reader as someone who should care about overlooked details)

### 8. Rhetorical Devices: Repetitive parallel structure for emphasis
- "from DeepBlue to AlphaGo, and now to DeepSeek" (historical progression pattern)
- "moving away from large groups of fungible labelers toward small, well-paid groups of experts who don't label so much as guide and steer models" (from-toward construction with elaborating clause)
- "The future belongs to architectures that learn efficiently, not datasets that scale infinitely. Smart money is betting on systems that can identify their own gaps and improve iteratively. The next wave of AI companies will win through learning velocity, not data hoarding." (three parallel declarative statements building momentum)

### 9. Word-Level Choices: Mix of technical precision and colloquial verbs
- "dropped a bombshell" (dramatic, informal verb for major announcement)
- "giddy with palpable excitement" (emotional language in technical piece)
- "absolutely shattering assumptions" (intensifier + violent verb for conceptual change)

### 10. Paragraph Structure: Topic sentence → evidence → implication pattern
- "Post training is more interesting. It's changed quite significantly over the last 3 odd years. Details are sparse, not too much gets out to the public. However, the open source community has been a ray of sunshine..." (claim, context, limitation, counter-point)
- "The pessimists were right about one thing: we are hitting a wall with traditional data labeling. But like many walls in AI, we're not so much crashing into it as finding a door right through it." (acknowledges opposing view, then reframes with extended metaphor)

## Post: Dune 2: Destiny and missed opportunities - a review

### 1. Sentence Rhythm: Mix of Long Complex and Short Punchy
**Evidence:**
- "In science fiction, Dune towers over everything else." (9 words - declarative opening)
- "Paul Atreides, the unwilling hero who has greatness thrust upon him, the water-starved Fremen, spice (Frank Herbert was definitely psychedelically experienced; I mean it was the 60's), sandworms—these are iconic shards of fiction." (37 words - list accumulation building to conclusion)
- "It meandered, dragged, and limped to a conclusion that left the audience with zero closure." (15 words - triple verb progression)

**Pattern:** Opens with short declaratives, then expands into complex sentences with embedded clauses and parenthetical asides, often using triple rhythms (meandered/dragged/limped).

### 2. Parenthetical Asides for Voice and Commentary
**Evidence:**
- "spice (Frank Herbert was definitely psychedelically experienced; I mean it was the 60's)"
- "If they ever make Dune 2, they'll have to rush through a lot of story, I remember thinking."
- "Vilenueve's duology looks, sounds, and feels fantastic - but it's like a fine dining meal that leaves you asking, 'Was that it?' at the end."

**Pattern:** Uses parentheticals and dashes to inject personal commentary, humor, and conversational tone into critical analysis.

### 3. Opening Paragraphs: Bold Declarative Statements
**Evidence:**
- "In science fiction, Dune towers over everything else."
- "Dune (2021) was a fresh attempt at adapting science fiction's Mount Everest by one of this century's finest directors."
- "Both movies fall flat at tackling the themes of belief."

**Pattern:** Each paragraph opens with a clear, confident thesis statement before unpacking the argument.

### 4. Transition Pattern: Contrast-Based ("But")
**Evidence:**
- "But the movie wasn't self-contained."
- "But the pacing still didn't seem to work."
- "However, this emphasis on spectacle and surface-level worldbuilding seems to come at the expense of the novel's thematic heart."

**Pattern:** Frequently uses "But" and "However" to pivot from acknowledgment of strengths to critique, creating a balanced analytical tone.

### 5. Metaphorical Comparisons for Critique
**Evidence:**
- "adapting science fiction's Mount Everest"
- "it's like a fine dining meal that leaves you asking, 'Was that it?' at the end"
- "these are iconic shards of fiction"

**Pattern:** Employs vivid metaphors (Mount Everest, fine dining, shards) to make abstract critical points concrete and memorable.

### 6. Lists with Em-Dashes for Accumulation
**Evidence:**
- "Paul Atreides, the unwilling hero who has greatness thrust upon him, the water-starved Fremen, spice (Frank Herbert was definitely psychedelically experienced; I mean it was the 60's), sandworms—these are iconic shards of fiction."
- "The sandworms, Giedi Prime, the Baron, Feyd Rautha, Arrakis, and Sietch Tabr all look believable, strange, and amazing."
- "the volatile, irrational power of human belief"

**Pattern:** Builds momentum through item accumulation, often punctuated with em-dashes leading to a synthesis statement.

### 7. Triple Adjective/Verb Clusters
**Evidence:**
- "It meandered, dragged, and limped to a conclusion"
- "believable, strange, and amazing"
- "looks, sounds, and feels fantastic"

**Pattern:** Consistently uses triadic structures for emphasis and rhythm, creating a more literary critical voice.

### 8. Direct Address Through Personal Reaction
**Evidence:**
- "If they ever make Dune 2, they'll have to rush through a lot of story, I remember thinking."
- "When I first walked out of the theatre a couple of days ago, I was ambivalent about Dune 2."
- "For me, the novel is transcendent in two areas"

**Pattern:** Positions analysis through personal experience ("I remember thinking," "For me") rather than purely objective criticism, creating intimacy.

### 9. Qualifying Acknowledgments Before Critique
**Evidence:**
- "It looked fantastic with inspired casting and design choices. But the pacing still didn't seem to work."
- "While Timothee Chalamet has the acting chops, the films portray this inner turmoil mostly through mood and visuals."
- "Villeneuve's Dune films are technically impressive and visually stunning, achieving a sense of realism and scale previously absent in adaptations. However, this emphasis on spectacle..."

**Pattern:** Systematically acknowledges strengths before pivoting to criticism, creating a fair-minded analytical voice that avoids pure negativity.

### 10. Ending with Quoted Authority + Final Synthesis
**Evidence:**
- "Herbert, in an interview, stated, 'You cannot divorce religion from politics, or politics from planetary ecology, or planetary ecology from human psychology.' Villeneuve's focus on politics and ecology misses the crucial link – the volatile, irrational power of human belief."
- Final paragraph synthesizes by invoking Herbert's own words, then delivers the ultimate verdict

**Pattern:** Closes major arguments by appealing to source authority (Herbert himself), then delivers a final synthesizing judgment that ties critique back to original vision.


## Post: Writer's Block and Product Management

### 1. Opening with Personal Admission/Vulnerability
Sets up essays by confessing uncertainty or imperfection upfront, creating an intimate, self-aware tone.

**Evidence:**
- "Every time I sit down to write, there's this speed bump I have to get over before I can get started."
- "I felt I knew almost everything there was to know about product management. It seemed like a simple job... Three years later, I realize I was wrong. Quite confidently wrong, in fact."
- "I gave him some answer, but I found it extremely irritating when I noticed that I didn't have the answer down pat."

### 2. Conversational Hedging and Self-Correction
Uses parenthetical asides and qualifiers to show thinking-in-progress, making the writing feel dialogic rather than declarative.

**Evidence:**
- "why my reader should care (I haven't cracked this yet)"
- "I like to think of companies in the context of organisms, even if the analogy is quite tortured."
- "(It's fun to think of sales as the gastric system lol)"

### 3. Sentence Rhythm: Short Declarative After Build-up
Follows complex sentences with punchy, definitive statements for emphasis and clarity.

**Evidence:**
- "Writing forces me to crystallize my thoughts. I have to think deeply in order to write something clear and coherent."
- "Three years later, I realize I was wrong. Quite confidently wrong, in fact."
- "You need this to translate your product vision to reality. Product managers are useless in a vacuum."

### 4. Reductive Simplification Followed by Complication
Presents ideas as deceptively simple lists or frameworks, then immediately challenges or complicates them.

**Evidence:**
- "1. Talk to customers 2. Decide what to build 3. Build??? 4. Profit" followed by "Three years later, I realize I was wrong... the devil is in the details."
- "It seemed like a simple job" immediately followed by the numbered list, then "As always, the devil is in the details."
- "The job is about two fundamental things: people and agency" then dedicates full sections to unpacking each.

### 5. Physical/Embodied Metaphors for Mental States
Translates abstract thinking into physical sensations and bodily experiences.

**Evidence:**
- "Every time I sit down to write, there's this speed bump I have to get over"
- "Staring at a blank screen is intimidating. The mind's blank and full at the same time."
- "That irritation I felt was a pretty strong signal. I knew there was a reason my brain was irritated, just like it is when I try to muster up the willpower to do some weights. My brain knew it had to work hard, so it was protesting."

### 6. Extended Analogies with Self-Aware Commentary
Uses creative metaphors (organisms, nervous systems) while explicitly acknowledging their limitations.

**Evidence:**
- "I like to think of companies in the context of organisms, even if the analogy is quite tortured."
- "Product, to extend this analogy, plays the part of the peripheral nervous system, converting intention to action."
- "Using the lens of human psychology, game theory and behavior is one of the most helpful ways a product manager can frame problems"

### 7. Concrete Mathematical/Quantified Examples
Illustrates abstract concepts through specific numerical scenarios with named characters and calculations.

**Evidence:**
- "Reductive Example: There are two product managers—high agency Aurangzeb and low agency Babar."
- "Aurangzeb releases 1 feature every sprint at a 40% success rate. He's high agency, so he improves his success rate by 0.5% every sprint."
- "After 50 sprints (approximately 2 years): Aurangzeb: 50 features released, ~28 successful feature releases"

### 8. Reader Positioning Through Second-Person Scenarios
Pulls reader into hypotheticals using "you" to make abstract points tangible and relatable.

**Evidence:**
- "Put yourself in the shoes of their teammates. You are a salesperson talking to an important client."
- "You need to bag this client so that you can use the commission to go on that Bali trip you've been planning for a while."
- "Who do you go to? Unless it's a business critical showstopper where getting everything just right is absolutely the top priority, I'd go to Aurangzeb."

### 9. Meta-Commentary on the Writing Process
Explicitly discusses the act of writing within the essay itself, making the process visible.

**Evidence:**
- "But if that was all, I'd not be writing this post."
- "In the rest of this post, I'll talk about how I thought I knew product management, and how writing forced me to confront my pitfalls and blind spots."
- "What does this discussion about product management have to do with writing and what did I get out of it? While writing this post, I didn't learn anything that I didn't know before."

### 10. Casual Humor Through Informal Asides
Injects levity via parenthetical jokes and internet-speak, maintaining approachability.

**Evidence:**
- "(It's fun to think of sales as the gastric system lol)"
- "3. Build??? 4. Profit" (referencing the South Park meme)
- "and his success rate stays flat" (delivered matter-of-factly as part of the numerical example)

## Post: Love in the Time of LLMs

### 1. Numbered Story Structure as Opening Device
The post opens with a distinctive numbered story pattern that creates conversational intimacy before making broader claims.

**Evidence:**
- "Story 1: I remember talking to my friend around the time ChatGPT came out."
- "Story 2: And then another friend, one who's an analytics VP at a reputed organization."
- "Story 3, scenario 1: Picture two friends, A and B who live quite far from each other and communicate regularly via text."

### 2. Parenthetical Asides for Sardonic Commentary
Uses parentheses to inject wry, knowing observations that undercut corporate messaging or add dark humor.

**Evidence:**
- "no prizes for guessing what that would be used for."
- "(already well underway)" - regarding porn as the initial application
- "It's surprising that a lot of in-office work is essentially doable by a word-predictor, but that is a story for another day."

### 3. Sentence Rhythm: Long, Accumulating Sentences Build to Revelation

But I wanted to separate sophistry from fact."

- "Difficulty in calculating historical economics also leaves us with no way to be more confident."
- "Maddison's numbers have been updated with more scientifically rigorous calculations in the 2020 version of this dataset..."
